This repository contains my first set of C projects; small programs I built after learning the fundamentals of C.\
I call this Stage 1 because itâ€™s the first stepping stone in my C programming journey.

The goal of this repo is to practice:
- Writing clean and modular C code.
- Using pointers, memory management, and file I/O.
- Building small but complete programs.

Each project folder contains a `main.c` file that contains the main code alongside a short description of the project.

To compile the project:
```
gcc main.c [OTHER_FILES].c -o output.exe
```
Then simply run:
```
./output.exe
```
